        <h4>A Wise Ruler</h4>
        <details>
            <summary> Who was responsible for uniting India for the first time? What year?</summary>
            <p>In 320 (B.C.), India was united under Chandragupta Maurya’s rule for the first time.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary> According to the text, “Then around AD 320, a new unifying power arose.” Who was responsible for this unifying power and what kingdom did this leader emerge from?</summary>

        <h4> Golden Age and Decline</h4>
        <details>
            <summary> As you’ve seen several times by now, many civilizations develop to a point where they experience a “golden age". Developments in the arts, sciences, mathematics, etc. are common. Summarize “The Gupta Golden Age” below:</summary>
            <p> Chandra Gupta II ruled during India’s golden age. During the golden age, mathematicians developed zero, discovered that the world was round and that the earth orbited around the sun. Also, “Kalidasa, one of India’s greatest writers, composed poems and plays in Sanskrit. Scribes, or writers, wrote down ancient spoken stories, including Hindu epic poems such as the Mahabharata and the Ramayana.”</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary> Which achievement during India’s golden age do you think was most significant? Explain.</summary>
            <p>During the golden age in India, I think that the most significant, and important, achievement was the proven theory that the Earth was round and that it evolved around the sun. I think that this achievement is the most significant because before modern science, and modern astronomy and astronomers, they concluded what is very important for science today.</p>

            <p>According to the text, the story of Vietnam most likely began with, “...the migration of settlers from southern China into the Red River delta.”</p>

        <details>
            <summary>What was a challenge Vietnam shared with Korea?</summary>

            <p>The Han Chinese (which I think is also the Han Dynasty), according to the text, “...seized control of Nam Viet, and it became a Chinese-ruled province for more than a thousand years.” This was after the 100-year period that Nam Viet ruled on its own.</p>

            <p>Because the Chinese rulers in Nam Viet forced their culture on the people, the Chinese began to resist their rule this “led to many violent uprisings.”</p>

        </details>

            <summary> How was Le Thanh Tong’s rule similar to the Ming Chinese rule of Vietnam?</summary>
            <p>Le Thanh Tongs rule was similar to the Ming Chinese rule in the areas of government, language and literature.

Yongle sponsored sea expeditions and encouraged local governments to build schools for commoners. He also sponsored great literary works...” Then, in the current section (‘Vietnamese Kingdoms’), the text states that, “He [Le Thanh Tong] actively promoted China's government systems as well as its language, art and literature.</p>
