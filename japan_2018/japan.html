        <h3>Influences from China and Korea</h3>
        <p>Main Idea: Japan adopted ideas from Korea and China but adapted them to fit Japanese culture </p>
        <h4>Spreading New Ideas</h4>
        <details>
            <summary>In the early 600‚Äôs, how did Japan learn directly about Chinese culture?</summary>
            <p>The Japanese learned about Chinese culture directly because they sent official representatives, embassies,  from their country (Japan) to another country (China) on a mission. 
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What did the embassies bring back to Japan?</summary>
            <p>The Japanese embassies brought back knowledge, art, religion, technology and government ideas back to form what the Japanese lives looked like. </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What was the result of this new knowledge about Chinese culture?</summary>
            <p>The text states, ‚ÄúAs a result, China‚Äôs influence extended to such everyday practices as drinking tea, cooking and  gardening. Even the name the Japanese use to refer to their country, Nippon, comes from the Chinese language.‚Äù</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>According to the text, what areas did China have a major impact on Japanese culture?</summary>
            <p>The areas that China had a major impact on Japanese culture was writing. For example, the Japanese used the Chinese alphabet to write but modified it to be more fit to read and write Japanese (because Japanese words had more syllables than Chinese words). ‚ÄúThe Chinese also influenced how the Japanese viewed writing.‚Äù The Chinese helped the Japanese to understand that writing could also be used for telling stories and for ‚Äúcultural reasons‚Äù not just for keeping records.</p>
        </details>
       <h4>Adapting Influences</h4>
       <details>
           <summary>Although the Japanese were influenced in many ways by the Chinese, they were still able to create their own distinctive culture. According to the text, how were they able to do this?</summary>
           <p>Yes, the Japanese were still able to create their own distinctive culture although the Chinese helped to create their culture. According to the text, ‚ÄúThey [the Japanese] carefully selected what suited them and then adapted it to their own needs, which led to a distinctive Japanese culture.‚Äù</p>
       </details>
       <details>
           <summary>Briefly describe one example of this:</summary>
            <p>One example of the Japanese and how they adapted a Chinese idea was the idea of government. The Chinese government put people in power based on their work and examinations. However, the Japanese emperors chose who would be government officials (and in power) not how well they could perform a task. </p>
       </details>
       <details>
           <summary>In what year did Japan stop sending major missions (embassies) to China?</summary>
           <p>The text states, ‚ÄúAfter 839, Japan no longer sent any major missions to China.‚Äù This was due to the progression of their own Japanese society.</p>
       </details>
       <details>
           <summary>In what ways did the Chinese culture influence Prince Shotoku?</summary>
           <p>The Chinese culture influenced Prince Shotoku and the new Japanese culture  in the ways of government, bureaucracy, and religious practices. Prince Shotoku added Buddhism to Japan from China  and promoted it by building temples for worship throughout the country. Also, the text states that, ‚ÄúShotoku reshaped the Japanese government by incorporating many Chinese influences, which included setting up a centralized government and bureaucracy.‚Äù</p>
       </details>
       <details>
           <summary>How do you think bringing Chinese scholars, artists, and craftsmen into Japan affected Japanese culture?</summary>
           <p>I think that bringing Chinese scholars, artists, and craftsmen into Japan affected Japanese culture because the Chinese probably spread their ideas on to the Japanese because they were in constant contact with them. I think that Shotoku did this so that their Chinese culture could be spread onto the not completely formed Japanese culture.</p>
       </details>
       <details>
           <summary>What effect did appointing government positions based on merit instead of heredity have on Japan? Do you think this change was necessary? Explain.</summary>
           <p> The effect of appointing government positions based on merit and not heredity was that because they were chosen based on merit, any emperors that were next in line and not needed wouldn‚Äôt be able to have the throne. Also, rulers were chosen based on whether they were deserving or not and because they were deserving, they were most capable to make good and right decisions for the government.</p>
       </details>
       <details>
           <summary>Why do you think Shotoku‚Äôs aunt, Empress Suiku, appointed her nephew, Shotoku, as regent over her own sons?</summary>
           <p> I think that Empress Suiku appointed her nephew Shotoku to be regent over her own sons because Shotoku was apart of the powerful Soga family.</p>

The Noh was formed in 1300 and kabuki was formed 300 years later in the 1600s however, the two forms of drama are opposite of each other. According to the text, ‚ÄúNoh grew out of Shinto rituals and often retold well-known folktales. Their movements were deliberately slow and choreographed to music to create a powerful effect.‚Äù However, ‚ÄúKabuki developed as a contrast to Noh and was more lively and understandable. They wore luxurious costumes that reflected their characters‚Äô status. Their elaborate makeup highlighted important facial expressions, such as smiling or frowning.‚Äù</p>
